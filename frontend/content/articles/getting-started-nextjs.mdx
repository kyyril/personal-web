# Introduction to Next.js 15 App Router

Next.js 15 introduces the powerful **App Router** for building modern web applications. In this article, we'll discuss the basics of using Next.js 15 with App Router.

## What is App Router?

App Router is a new routing system in Next.js that gives us the ability to use:

- Server Components
- Streaming
- Built-in optimization
- and much more...

## Setting Up Your First Project

To start a Next.js 15 project, we can use:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript --tailwind --eslint
```

### Directory Structure

App Router uses a different folder structure:

```
app/
├── layout.tsx
├── page.tsx
├── blog/
│   ├── page.tsx
│   └── [slug]/
│       └── page.tsx
```

## Basic Component Example

Let's create a simple component:

```tsx
// components/HelloWorld.tsx
export default function HelloWorld() {
  return (
    <div className="text-center py-8">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-600">
        Hello World with Next.js 15!
      </h1>
      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
        Building modern web applications has never been easier.
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Key Features
