Next.js 15 introduces the powerful **App Router** for building modern web applications. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the fundamentals of using Next.js 15 with App Router.

## What is App Router?

App Router is a revolutionary routing system in Next.js that provides:

- **Server Components** - Build components that run on the server
- **Streaming** - Progressive rendering for better performance
- **Built-in optimization** - Automatic code splitting and optimization
- **Enhanced developer experience** - Better DX with file-system based routing

## Setting Up Your First Project

To create a new Next.js 15 project with App Router, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript --tailwind --eslint
```

### Project Directory Structure

App Router uses a file-system based routing approach:

```
app/
├── layout.tsx
├── page.tsx
├── blog/
│   ├── page.tsx
│   └── [slug]/
│       └── page.tsx
├── about/
│   └── page.tsx
└── globals.css
```

## Creating Your First Component

Let's build a simple component to understand the basics:

```tsx
// components/HelloWorld.tsx
export default function HelloWorld() {
  return (
    <div className="text-center py-8">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-600">
        Hello World with Next.js 15!
      </h1>
      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
        Building modern web applications has never been easier.
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Key App Router Features

### Server Components

Server Components provide several advantages:

- **Reduced bundle size** - Code only runs on the server
- **Better performance** - Faster initial page loads
- **Automatic code splitting** - Optimized loading automatically
- **SEO benefits** - Better search engine optimization

### Streaming

Streaming enhances user experience with:

- **Progressive rendering** - Show content as it becomes available
- **Selective hydration** - Hydrate only interactive parts
- **Faster perceived performance** - Users see content sooner
- **Better error boundaries** - Handle errors gracefully

### Layout System

App Router introduces a powerful layout system:

- **Root layout** - Shared layout for entire application
- **Nested layouts** - Layouts can be nested for different sections
- **Loading states** - Built-in loading UI support
- **Error handling** - Granular error boundaries

## Conclusion

Next.js 15 with App Router represents a significant advancement in React development. It provides an exceptional developer experience while delivering superior performance and user experience.

The combination of Server Components, Streaming, and the new Layout System makes Next.js 15 App Router the ideal choice for building modern web applications in 2025 and beyond.
