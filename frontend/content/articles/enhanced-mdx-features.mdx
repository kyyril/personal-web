Welcome to this comprehensive showcase of enhanced MDX rendering capabilities. This article demonstrates various rich content elements that make your blog posts more engaging and visually appealing.

# Blockquotes with Author Attribution

Blockquotes can now include author attribution. Simply add `-- Author Name` at the end of your blockquote:

> The best way to predict the future is to create it.
> -- Peter Drucker

> Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.
> -- Steve Jobs

# Enhanced Images with Captions

Images now support captions using the `title` attribute in markdown:

# Callout Boxes

Use callout boxes to highlight important information:

<div class="callout-info">
  **Info Callout:** This is useful for general information that readers should
  pay attention to.
</div>

<div class="callout-warning">
  **Warning Callout:** Be careful with this important warning message.
</div>

<div class="callout-success">
  **Success Callout:** Great job! This indicates successful completion of a
  task.
</div>

<div class="callout-error">
  **Error Callout:** Something went wrong. Check your code and try again.
</div>

# Collapsible Sections

Create expandable content sections for better organization:

<details>
<summary>What is MDX?</summary>

MDX is a format that allows you to write JSX in your Markdown documents. It combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components, enabling you to create rich, interactive content.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How does it work?</summary>

MDX files are processed by remark and rehype plugins that transform the content into React components. This allows you to use custom components directly in your markdown while maintaining readability.

</details>

# Highlighted Text

Use the `<mark>` tag to highlight important text:

The `<mark>` element represents text which is <mark>marked or highlighted</mark> for reference or notation purposes.

# Code Blocks with Copy Functionality

Code blocks now include syntax highlighting and copy-to-clipboard functionality:

```javascript
function greetUser(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}! Welcome to enhanced MDX rendering.`);
  return `Greeting sent to ${name}`;
}

// Usage
greetUser("Developer");
```

```python
def calculate_fibonacci(n):
    """Calculate the nth Fibonacci number"""
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return calculate_fibonacci(n-1) + calculate_fibonacci(n-2)

# Example usage
print(calculate_fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```

# Advanced Lists

- **Feature 1:** Enhanced list styling with custom bullets
- **Feature 2:** Better spacing and typography
- **Feature 3:** Improved readability across devices

# Mathematical Expressions

While not natively supported in this renderer, you can use inline code for simple expressions: `E = mc²` or `a² + b² = c²`.
